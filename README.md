# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### Using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and matplotlib view manage and create a summary of ride sharing data by city type. Create a multiple line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type.


## Data Wrangling

### Before data could be plotted, several maintenance and reorganization operations were run on the data. Using the groupby(), count(), and sum() functions we were able to create a new data frame with specific columns indexed on our city types.

### We were also able to leverage the resample() and pivot() functions to create a data frame on a selected time frame. 

### Plotting the data with matplotlib, we used a preset style (style = fivethirty eight), and added custom x & y labels and title using our plt syntax.

## Summary 
### Three Takeaways from the Data:
### Incentivizing more drivers to take rural fares, could help expand market in that area.
### Suburban Total fares is almost half of Urban total fares, despite less than half as many drivers.
### Late Feb. thru early April are peak times to increase base fare to increase revenue across city type.
